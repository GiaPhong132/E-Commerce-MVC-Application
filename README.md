# E-commerce

This is our Programming Integration Project. The main concept in this project is MVC(Model-View-Controller) model.

Main topic:

Based on Shopee UI, we build a back-end to stimulate Shopee's operation similar to Shopee in the real world.
We have edited some elements of Shopee UI to fit with this project and for some reason, we don't want to copy all Shopee UI.
We build this project for the main actor, the user. Users can do some actions similar to the Shopee in the real world but will have some limitations and differences.
You can find the way to set up, note, and some necessary to run this project in "https://github.com/GiaPhong132/Source_code/blob/main/README.md"

Improvement:

There are many features we need to build to compare with Shopee application. We will add some sites and interact with them. build additional admin sites to manage the product and people who register to sell products in my business.
After all, with the feature we have built, it's should still local with the main purpose being the demo. We will try to deploy it in the future with many new and modern features.
